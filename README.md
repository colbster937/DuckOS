<h2 align="center">DuckOS in the future 🕒</h2>
<p align="center">While the future of DuckOS remains uncertain, there are exciting plans for its development. As more time becomes available, the following features are envisioned to enhance DuckOS:</p><br>
<p align="center">• An app menu that allows users to customize their taskbar by adding or removing apps to suit their preferences.</p>
<p align="center">• Implementation of a robust proxy backend to enhance internet accessibility, overcoming censorship.</p>
<p align="center">• Seamless User Experience: Enjoy the convenience of effortless data synchronization across devices within DuckOS. Your preferences and important data will be seamlessly available to you, providing a consistent and personalized user experience.</p>

<h2 align="center">Deploying DuckOS 🚀</h2>
<p align="center">The world's leading web-based operating system remains unblocked by any hosting services to date! You have the opportunity to host DuckOS independently by forking this repository on Repl.it <a href="https://replit.com/github/GikitSRC/DuckOS-V5">here!</a><br>In the near future, DuckOS will integrate a proxy directly into its system, eliminating the need for iFrame elements. Unfortunately, this means that hosting DuckOS independently will no longer be possible 😔</p>
