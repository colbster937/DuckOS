<h1>Skyhax Fallon Middle School Referral Program</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Skyhax Fallon Middle School Referral Program! This fantastic opportunity allows members of Fallon Middle School to not only earn some extra cash but also gain valuable experience in sales and entrepreneurship. With the potential to earn up to $20 a week, it's an exciting venture for everyone involved.</p>
</div>
    <div class="howork">
<h2>How Does This Program Work?</h2>
<p>Here's a breakdown of how the program operates:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Receive Your Candy Supply</strong><br> Participants will be provided with a selection of delicious candies that you can distribute within your network.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: No Upfront Costs</strong><br> The best part is that there are no upfront costs! You won't need to make any payments until you've successfully sold all of the candy.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Pricing Flexibility</strong><br> You have the flexibility to set your own selling prices. This means you can tailor your sales strategy to maximize your earnings.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Profit Sharing</strong><br> It's important to note that we kindly request 50% of the profits as our share. However, there's a minimum of $5 that you must return. This minimum is calculated based on the quantity of candy we provide you with. For example, if you receive 5 packs of candy, you'll need to return either $5 or 50% of your total earnings, whichever amount is greater.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="howork">
<h2>Consequences of Misconduct</h2>
<p>We want to ensure that everyone involved in the program acts responsibly and with integrity. If someone decides to run away with the candy supply or engage in any form of misconduct, like tattleing on the teachers, there will be consequences:</p>
<p><strong>1. Legal Action:</strong> Running away with the candy or engaging in dishonest activities may lead to legal actions being taken against the individual involved.</p>
<p><strong>2. Loss of Earnings:</strong> Any unpaid earnings or profits will be forfeited, and the individual will not receive any compensation.</p>
<p><strong>3. School Consequences:</strong> We will find you. Just, don't.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="howork">
<h2>Ready to Get Started?</h2>
<p>We're excited to have you on board for the Skyhax Fallon Middle School Referral Program. It's an opportunity to have fun, build your entrepreneurial skills, and earn money while doing so. Get ready to sweeten your journey with us, and remember to act responsibly to avoid any consequences!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Once you have an in-person meeting with one of our representatives, you'll have the opportunity to engage in a conversation with the owner. Following this interaction, an official Skyhax webpage will be created exclusively for you. This personalized webpage will provide you with real-time access to your earnings and a detailed transaction history. It's important to note that the identities of all individuals who meet you in person will remain anonymous, ensuring that our involvement remains confidential and inaccessible to school staff.</p>
